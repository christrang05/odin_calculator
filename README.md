# calculator

project: create a functional calculator that takes advantage of using the standard operators, clearing the calculator, and storing the numbers properly so that the operate function may work.

I learned how to properly interact between the html, css, and javascript on a foundational level. Being able to seperate the html into it's seperate ids and divs, style that html into becoming a standard iphone calculator display using grid, and adding functional javascript to the respective buttons and storing the numbers used to be called in the operate function.
